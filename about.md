**Hello.**

My name is **Drew Youngwerth**. I'm currently a software developer at VersaBuilt Robotics. I've always been 
passionate about computers and technology and have been an active developer since 2013. 

My current stack is: 

- NodeJS
- Typescript
- VSCode
- Git
- macOS
- ZSH


I use this blog as a way to help cement lessons I've learned and will learn through my career as a developer.
I figured it might me a good reference for me in the future. In the likely scenario I run into a problem I've
already solved I can look back on this blog and solve the problem faster. Hopefully others might find it useful too.

**Enjoy the site!**
